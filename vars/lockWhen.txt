This step wraps lock step from [Lockable resources plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Lockable+Resources+Plugin) and adds condition expression

Definition:

```groovy
def lockWhen(LinkedHashMap params, boolean expression, Closure body) {}
```

Usage:

```groovy
boolean shouldLock = someExpression
// Takes same parameters as lock step as first argument
lockWhen([resource: 'my-lockable-resource'], shouldLock) {
    // your code that needs to be executed inside lock here
}
```
